# matroid-realization

This project uses code from the [Github repository](https://github.com/dcorey2814/matroidRealizationSpaces/tree/main) from Daniel Corey and Dante Luber used for the paper ["Singular matroid realization spaces"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11915). The goal of this project is to classify the irreducibility of realization spaces, up to complex conjugation, of simple $(3,11)$-matroids with the 3 lines property. 

The Jupyter notebook `collect_polynomials.ipynb` is written in Julia and utilizes Daniel Corey's and Dante Luber's code to obtain the polynomials that can generate the ideals of the realization spaces of the matroids we are interested in. The calculated polynomials have been written to the directory `data`. The file `data/univariate_polys.txt` gives the polynomials that generate the ideals of the realization spaces of the matroids given [here](https://github.com/dcorey2814/matroidRealizationSpaces/tree/main/d3n11/data) in the file `univariate_ideal_3_11.dat` in the same order. These are the matroids that have a realization space that can be described by a principal, univariate ideal. Similarly, `data/multivariate_polys.txt` gives polynomials corresponding to the matroids given in `multivariate_principal_ideal_3_11.dat` of [this directory](https://github.com/dcorey2814/matroidRealizationSpaces/tree/main/d3n11/data), which are matroids that have a realization space that can be described by a principal, multivariate ideal but not by a principal, univariate ideal.

The files `data/univariate_polys.txt` and `data/multivariate_polys.txt` were then fed to `determine_poly_irreducibility.ipynb` and processed with SageMath. Out of the 16234 simple $(3,11)$-matroids with the 3 lines property, there are
- 4718 are not realizable over $\mathbb{C}$,
- 7745 with irreducible realization space and thus irreducible realization space up to complex conjugation,
- 870 with realization space that consists of two irreducible complex conjugate components and thus irreducible realization space up to complex conjugation, and
- 2901 with realization space that consists of at least two irreducible components up to complex conjugation and thus reducible realization space up to complex conjugation.

Out of the 2901 matroids with realization space that consists of at least two irreducible components up to complex conjugation, there are 42 where there are at least two components whose closures share a common point. However, these common points cannot be in the realization space as it would make the realization space singular and contradict the result of "Singular matroid realization spaces" stating that all the realization spaces for $(3,11)$-matroids are smooth. 

The 4718 cases that are not realizable over $\mathbb{C}$ are previously calculated [here](https://github.com/dcorey2814/matroidRealizationSpaces/blob/main/d3n11/data/nonrealizable_3_11.dat). There are also 2220 cases where the matroid has a maximal circuit so that the ideal of the realization space is the zero ideal (and thus the realization space is irreducible), and those are previously calculated [here](https://github.com/dcorey2814/matroidRealizationSpaces/blob/main/d3n11/data/zero_ideal_3_11.dat). 

Out of the 3658 matroids in `univariate_ideal_3_11.dat` (principal, univariate ideal), there are 808 cases whose realization space is two irreducible complex conjugate components, 0 cases that have realization space that is irreducible, and there are 2850 cases where the realization space is at least two irreducible components up to complex conjugation. The indices of the lines of `univariate_ideal_3_11.dat` that belong to each of these three different types of realization spaces are given in `results/uni_comp_conj.txt`, `results/uni_irreducible.txt`, and `results/uni_reducible.txt`, respectively. Note that the indexing in the .txt files start from 0.

Out of the 5638 matroids in `multivariate_principal_ideal_3_11.dat` (principal, multivariate ideal), there are 62 cases whose realization space is two irreducible complex conjugate components, 5525 cases that have realization space that is irreducible, there are 9 cases where the realization space is at least two irreducible components up to complex conjugation and no pairs of these components share a point in their closures, and there are 42 cases where the realization space is at least two irreducible components up to complex conjugation and at least one pair of these components share a point in their closures. The indices of the lines of `multivariate_principal_ideal_3_11.dat` that belong to each of these four different types of realization spaces are given in `results/mult_comp_conj.txt`, `results/multi_irreducible.txt`, `results/multi_reducible.txt`, and `results/multi_reducible_connected.txt`, respectively. Again, the indexing in the .txt files start from 0.
